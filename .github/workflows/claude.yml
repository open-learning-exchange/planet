            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns

            Adhere to the following instructions when adding review comments:
            1. **Issues Found**
               - List only concrete problems or risks (bugs, security, performance, maintainability).
               - Assign a priority to each: HIGH (must fix), MEDIUM (should fix), LOW (nice to fix).
               - If you're unsure, don't speculate, leave it blank.
               - Consult the `Style-Guide.md` to ensure that the project style is adhered to.
            2. **Final Recommendation**
               - Choose one: APPROVE or REQUEST CHANGES.
               - Justify in 1â€“2 sentences based on the issues above.
               - If no issues found, explicitly state 'No issues found' before approving.
            Do not include verbose summaries, comparisons to past reviews, or re-descriptions of the code. Only raise actionable feedback.
