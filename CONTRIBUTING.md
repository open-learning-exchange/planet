# About OLE

The Open Learning Exchange (OLE) provides a software suite and approach to learning that address the three most serious barriers to learning - the lack of quality materials, the lack of effective teachers, and the lack of meaningful connections with the rest of the world. We believe learning is meaningful when it is personalized, team supported & community-based, globally connected, scalable, and sustainable. In partnership with nation-based educational partners OLE provides strategic advice and technical support, and regularly assembles our partners to share and learn from each other.

Planet Learning is a generic learning system that is designed to be adapted to diverse  challenges facing nations and their communities. It is being used to improve early education, secondary schools, village health, youth workforce development, and economic and community development.

Planet Learning is designed to be available to everyone, everywhere, all the time. At the core of Planet Learning is a repository of free, open access and public domain resources to benefit all learners. 

The OLE platform has two components that work together:

* A cloud-based repository used to manage learning content and to aggregate user metrics (Nation server); and
* A local server that delivers learning resources, courses, tests, and learner management tools via a local area network (Community server).

You can get on overview of our concept of planet learning here.
