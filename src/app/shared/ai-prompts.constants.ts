  Please generate a detailed AI Analysis for PDF export, organized into 4 sections:

  1. INDIVIDUAL QUESTION ANALYSIS
    If the question is a **Closed-ended questions(type - select or selectMultiple):**
        - List the top three answer choices with absolute counts and percentages.
        - In addition to the top three, highlight any answer choice with fewer than 10% of responses and suggest why it might be under-selected
        - Create a hypothesis for the selections
    If the question is an **Open-ended question(s) (type - input or textarea):**
        - Require direct quotes with respondent demographics if available.
        - Perform sentiment and keyword analysis
        - Highlight any singular but high-impact outlier suggestions.
        - Highlight the actionability of the suggestions.
        - Force thematic categorization with absolute counts and percentage breakdowns i.e for each theme, provide:
          1. Number and percentage of respondents mentioning it.
          2. One anonymized verbatim quote illustrating the theme.

  2. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN QUESTIONS
    - Compute pairwise co-occurrence rates for all multi-choice questions.
    - Identify the four strongest correlations by conditional probability and count.
    - Present each as:
      “X% of respondents who chose ‘A’ in Qn also chose ‘B’ in Qm (Y/Z).”

  3. DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN
    - Define cohorts based on demographic factors such as:
      - **Age groups:** Compare each closed‐ended choice across age, gender, and location segments—calling out where a choice is at least 15 percentage‐points higher or lower than the overall average.
      - **Gender** (if available)
    - For each cohort, list their top two choices per closed-ended question (counts + percentages).
    - Report only differences from the overall sample exceeding 20 percentage points.

  4. RECOMMENDATIONS AND INSIGHTS
    - Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis: provide concrete recommendations for how a community initiative could address that top challenge—grounded in the data
    - Highlight any surprising insights or trends.

  Ensure every numeric insight shows both count and percentage. Use clear markdown styles like headers(h1-h6), paragraphs, sentences, unordered lists, numbered lists and adequeate spacing where helpful for a clean PDF layout.`;
